            “You know, when I look at you, I get the same kind of feeling as
            when I’m looking out over a beautiful place like this. You take my
            breath away. I love you.” As we lean in for a happy kiss, Gavin
            screams with disgust, Brianna squeals with approval, David watches
            intently, and Jude… Jude’s looking through a drainage tunnel and
            pretending there’s another kid on the other side. Moments later
            after we’ve started walking again, I sense a certain silence
            reaching out and drawing my attention. Will. “What was he… Oh, yeah!
            The book!” I slowed my pace, bumping into him affectionately. “So we
            were staying inside, right?” I asked, looking for his book. “Wait…
            Where’d it go…?” The composition pad had seemingly vanished. I
            looked him up and down, yet there only peculiar thing was the way he
            was holding his mouth. Almost like something was… in it? I wondered…
            I examined… I poked his cheeks… Inconclusive. I caught Gavin
            observing this brief routine, his braces reflecting the setting sun
            in his smile. “Now… Smackers…” I said tenderly. “You’re not
            expecting me to believe you put the book in your mouth, are you?”
            “Mmmh, mmhmm, mm-mmm-mm!” He “mmm”ed back at me. I watched him
            closely as we all continued our walk. I told him a joke or two, the
            cheeks stayed puffed out; I jabbed him in the neck with my deft
            fingertips, the cheeks stayed puffed out; I reported him to Heidi
            and she shouted back, “Simon, stop being weird! This is supposed to
            be a nice walk!”, yet nevertheless, the cheeks stayed puffed out. As
            a last resort, I took out my keys. I folded one key back along the
            ring, humming unintelligible notes: I had his attention. One after
            the other, I inspected each key and spun it to the back of the line
            until finally, after cycling through my 4 keys and a pen at least a
            half dozen times, I exclaimed, “Ah! There it is! My mouth-unlocking
            key!” I extended it towards Will’s mouth, twisted it in the
            invisible lock an inch in front of his mouth, and he spoke! “Aww, I
            was just foolin’!” He said, a hand on the back of his head. “I
            stashed the book in my pants.” He dug a hand in between his skin and
            the fabric of his jeans, and out came the little black and white
            notebook, curved to roughly the shape of his thigh. He opened the
            book to the dog-ear he’d left on page 39, and opened his mouth to
            speak – “So, ‘I persuaded Trevor to go with me to investigate the
            noise we’d heard a few rooms over,’” he read aloud from the
            notebook, “when suddenly –” We walked right into Brianna, who’d
            stopped to look down a driveway at a group of dogs and garden
            gnomes. “Brianna!” We shouted. “Sorry, sorry, suh-horry!” She said,
            waving her hands and tilting her head. We glared at the back of her
            head as she pranced forward a few steps to bring her next to Heidi
            and David. An exchanged look of “ugh” between us gentlemen, and an
            opening of the book later – “Hey guys! Who wants a ride back!” rang
            in our ears, as Greg asked our little circus of individuals from the
            window of the van if anyone wanted to take the easy way home.
